This includes protoptye methods, along with other JavaScript concepts. The game provides the user with a series of flashcards, each turn shows the quetion on the flashcard, along with answer options. The user can choose their guess. If their guess is correct, they can move along to the next flashcard question. If incorrect, they are propmted to answer the same question.
